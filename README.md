### Envestnet Account Token APIs

Financial institutions (FIs) or FinTech customers using the account
verification product to provide digital payment services can eliminate the
risk of storing users' sensitive financial account information using
Account Token endpoints. The endpoints allow customers to create an
account-specific token that the payment processors can use to retrieve
account information.

### Envestnet Account Verification APIs

This guide will show the basics of verifying accounts using Yodlee.
Account verification can help enable payments, avoid overdrafts, reduce
fraud, and more.  Verifying an account simply means your user has
authenticated against the account, and then you get detailed information
for the problem you're trying to solve. For instance, for payments, you
might want to prove a user has access to an account, get the account
routing number, and check the amount of money in it.
