      verification product to provide digital payment services can eliminate the

      This guide will show the basics of verifying accounts using Yodlee.
      Account verification can help enable payments, avoid overdrafts, reduce
      fraud, and more.  Verifying an account simply means your user has
      authenticated against the account, and then you get detailed information
      for the problem you're trying to solve. For instance, for payments, you
      might want to prove a user has access to an account, get the account
      routing number, and check the amount of money in it.
